# Hello, I'm Armando!

I am a data scientist with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science from The University of California Santa Barbara.

I'm passionate about analyzing and predicting product analytics and user experiences. My work usually involves A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, machine learning, time series analysis, reporting and insights, and creating new metrics. 
I primarily use tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Adobe Analytics.

I previously served as the Director of Operations for a nationwide e-commerce & retail chain in the liquor industry as well as the Chief Executive Officer for a marketing company.
